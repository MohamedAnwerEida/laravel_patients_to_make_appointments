# laravel_patients_to_make_appointments
 we need to design an application, in this application we will open cases for patients to make appointments with doctor through admin portal who can receive cases and assign it to physicians with different specialties, and send notification to doctor and patient with the appointment, You should bear in mind that the doctor and the patient can refuse the appointment, in this case the appointment  will be  redirected again to admin and he will reschedule the appointment or change the doctor and assign the case to another doctor.
